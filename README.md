# hello-world
My first repository. 

Hello everyone! My name is Walker Green. I'm a self-taught computer programmer. I currently do improv comedy at Second City, UCB, and the Philly Improv Theater. At age 19 I got an anti-corruption law passed through the NJ Legislature. I also like to longboard places.
